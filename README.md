# portal-forum
This Project serves a Back-End that carries out an API REST, for a forum-like social sharing website. It’s built around users submitting content, which everyone can then upvote on. It’s divided into smaller communities called Portals. A Portal is simply a board devoted to a specific topic. It also addresses the user management entirely.
